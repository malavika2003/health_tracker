# health_tracker

Mental health is an aspect of everyone's life, although, for some, it's more of a struggle than for others, especially at college where students are facing new and stressful stimuli every day. With a large population now working from home and staying away from loved ones, the mental health situation has deteriorated. As such, it becomes important to track and remedy any problems before they get too serious. We try to achieve this using the health tracking app. In this app user can see some motivational quotes and pictures to refresh our mind with good vibe. User can add tasks and checklist them. User can hear songs, watch videos related to Yoga , and can read and write blogs. User can also chat with the our AI powered healthbot.

## Tech stack

* Initializing firebase for the project and forming the backend architecture with the help of Firebase database and authentication API.
* This app uses Dialogflow for chatbot. Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. Using Dialogflow, you can provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product.
* Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through real time listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.
